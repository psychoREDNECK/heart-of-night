# Push Mobile Improvements to GitHub

All the mobile improvements are saved in Git! Here's what's ready to push:

## Recent Changes:
✅ **Larger buttons** - All buttons now have minimum 44px height for easier tapping
✅ **Fixed header** - "HEART OF NIGHT" stays visible at the top with shadow
✅ **File browser button** - Mobile users can now tap "Select Files" instead of drag-and-drop
✅ **Better spacing** - Improved touch targets throughout the app
✅ **Mobile-specific CSS** - Responsive design for Samsung Galaxy S10 and other devices

## To Push to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

## What Happens Next:
1. GitHub Actions will automatically start building new APKs
2. Both debug and release APKs will include all mobile improvements
3. APKs will be available in the Actions tab after ~10 minutes

## Your Mobile-Ready APKs Will Have:
- Easy-to-tap buttons (48x48px minimum)
- File selection that works on touch screens
- Proper header that stays visible
- Optimized layout for Samsung Galaxy S10

The GitHub repository will be fully updated with all the mobile accessibility improvements!
